# Angular Basic

Angular is a full featured Javascript framework created and maintained by google and is used for building front-end part of a full stack application. Angular is very popular in large enterprise.

AngularJS was released on 2010. It is not recommanded and should be updated to angular.

Angular refers to version 2+. Right now we are using version 7 but 2-7 is the same frame work with few changes mostly under the hood.

# Why use Angular?

1) Organized front-end structure(Component, Model, Services)
2) Extremely powerful & full featured.
3) All-in-one solution (Routing, HTTP, RXJS etc).
4) Build powerful SPA (Single Page Application) apps.
5) MVC- model, view, controller design pattern.
6) Type Script. 
7) Fantastic CLI.

# Why you should know before learning angular?

Java Script Fundamentals (Objects, arrays, conditions etc)

# It may help to learn these first

1) Typescript
2) Classes
3) Hign Order Array Methods- forEach, map, filter.
4) Arrow Functions
5) Promises & Observables
6) MVC Pattern

# Uses

1) Uses TypeScript for static types (variables, functions, params)
2) Component based (like other frameworks)
3) Uses "services" to share data/fucntionality between components
4) Concept of modules (root module, form modules, http module etc)
5) Uses RxJS "observables" for async operations
6) Steep learning curve relative to other frameworks.

# Angular CLI

$ ng new myapp   ----------- create a new application

$ ng serve       ----------- run the dev server

$ ng build       ----------- will build out our asset

$ ng generate component todos  ---- to generate component 

$ ng generate service todos    ---- to generate service

$ ng generate module app-routing ---- to generate module


We can use state management like ngrx and redux with Angular for large apps
